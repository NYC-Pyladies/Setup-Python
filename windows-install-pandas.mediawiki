== Our recommendation ==

On Windows, to get Pandas running, you have to install NumPy first.

To install NumPy:

* Click and download http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/n/numpy/numpy-1.6.1.win32-py2.7.exe
* Run the installer, and follow the process to the end.

Then, to install Pandas:

* Click and download http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/p/pandas/pandas-0.9.1.win32-py2.7.exe
* Run the installer, and follow the process to the end.

Finally, you should install a graphing library to generate visual charts:

* Click and download https://github.com/downloads/matplotlib/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.2.0.win32-py2.7.exe
* Run the installer, and follow the process to the end.

== Test it ==

To make sure the process worked, open up a Python interpreter prompt. You should
see this familiar prompt:

 >>>

In that prompt, type the following:

 >>> import numpy
 >>> print numpy.__version__

You should see it print '''1.6.1'''.

To make sure pandas is installed properly, you can do something similar:

 >>> import pandas
 >>> print pandas.__version__

You should see it print '''0.8.1'''.

To make sure matplotlib is installed properly, type the following into the Python interpreter:

 >>> import matplotlib
 >>> print matplotlib.__version__

You should see it print '''1.2.0'''.

== Success! ==

Now you have a Python environment set up to do high performance numeric calculations (with NumPy), do speedy statistical data manipulation (with pandas), and generate data visualizations (with matplotlib)!
