= PyData Workshop-Sprint 2012 at NYC  =

Are you interested in a one-day hands-on intensive [http://pandas.pydata.org/  Pandas] workshop and sprint for new contributors with a Pandas core-dev leading the sprint? 

Read on...

== OBJECTIVE == 

The aim of this workshop and sprint is to encourage and rope in more bug triagers and new contributors to scientific programming in Python, by teaching attendees about data processing tools in Python, and have them contribute a patch to Pandas.

== Chang She, sprint leader == 
[http://www.lambdafoundry.com/team  Chang She], a core-developer for the Free/Libre source Pandas library for data analysis, will be the sprint leader conducting the workshop. He is also the co-founder of [http://lambdafoundry.com  LambdaFoundry], a company that provides high productivity solutions for Data Science.

== Workshop-Sprint format == 

It will be a small workshop to enable every attendee to ask questions freely and easily contribute to the Pandas scientific project. (Please note that this workshop and sprint is all about "you" - your opportunity to boot-strap yourself into a Pandas contributor).

* Background
Participants don't need prior experience in Pandas, but a basic understanding of Python and some kind of version control should be required. Knowledge of Numpy is a bonus but not a requirement either.
* Groups 
Registrations will be capped at 20-30 participants max. As per their interest, participants will be split into groups of 3-4 people or smaller groups.


=== WORKSHOP Timeline : 1015-1300 hrs === 
Here is a tentative schedule and format for how the day will be structured into two parts:

* 1000 hrs : Arrive at venue; meet and greet until 1015 hrs.
* 1010-1015 hrs : Brief introduction of the event, by the organizers. 
* 1015-1230 hrs : Introduction to Pydata in general, and introduction to Pandas, its features, work flow, etc.. to participants by Chang She.
* 1230-1300 hrs : Guided group work - Here, people can break up into small groups of 2-4 people, with each group picking one or two [https://github.com/pydata/pandas Pandas github issues]. They can try to make a pull request at the end. With guided group work, some of the participants should write the unit tests and some should work on the actual code.

===== Lunch =====
* 1300-1345 hrs: Lunch, sponsored by the [http://pythonsprints.com/ Python Software Foundation]

=== Afternoon : 1400-1715 hrs ===
* 1300-1500 hrs : Guided group work (continued) - Here, people can break up into small groups of 3-4 people, with each group picking one or two [https://github.com/pydata/pandas  Pandas github issues]. They can try to make a pull request at the end. With guided group work, some of the participants should write the unit tests and some should work on the actual code.
* 1500-1715 hrs: SPRINT time, with Chang She available as a mentor - The afternoon sprint will be "free form" and people who come can work on any [https://github.com/pydata/pandas Pandas tickets they like] - Even if it's just writing documentation, beginners who'd like to contribute would be more than welcome. With documentation, some of the participants can work on the phrasing and others can work on examples.
* 1715 hrs: Wrap-up, and discussion of next steps.
