== How to use this page ==

Go through each '''goal''' one by one, choosing the link
corresponding to your operating system.

If you have any questions, ask a staff member!

== Goal #1: set up Python ==

This section has instructions for installing Python and running Python from a command prompt.

* [[Windows set up Python|Windows]]
* [[OSX set up Python|OS X]]
* [[Linux set up Python|Linux]]

== Goal #2: prepare a text editor ==

In addition to being able to run Python, we are going to install a good text editor for writing and saving Python code during the workshop.

If you would like to use a different text editor from the recommendation for your operating system, please let a staff member know.

* [[Windows text editor|Windows]]
* [[OSX text editor|OS X]]
* [[Linux text editor|Linux]]

== Goal #3: practice starting and exiting Python ==

We'll do a lot of practicing at a Python prompt (this is "interactive" because you are typing the code and hitting enter to run it yourself, instead of running it from a file). So let's practice starting and exiting Python:

* [[Windows interactive Python|Windows]]
* [[OSX interactive Python|OS X]]
* [[Linux interactive Python|Linux]]

== Goal #4: install pandas ==
