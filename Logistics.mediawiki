= Logistics = 
Thank you for signing up for the PyData Workshop and Sprint with Chang She!

This wiki page contains a few logistics notes you'll need to know to make the best of the workshop, and help it run as smoothly as possible.

== What to bring ==

We expect you to bring yourself and a laptop computer, with a compatible network card, that can enable you to connect to a wi-fi network. Your machine can be running Windows, Mac OS, or a Linux distribution of your choice, or if it runs something else, that's cool, but you might run into issues with the workshop.

It is important that you bring a computer you can program on, rather than just a tablet or mobile phone.

=== Planning for food === 

We plan to provide lunch, thanks to the Python Software Foundation for sponsoring! 

== Laptop setup ==

Getting your computer configured to contribute to Pandas can be time-consuming, so we wrote a guide that you can work through.  You can find it here:

We strongly encourage you to work through it before the event. If you are having any trouble, we can help out! Please come 15 minutes early, by 9:40 am, to the venue so that one of the volunteers will be able to assist and work with you.
