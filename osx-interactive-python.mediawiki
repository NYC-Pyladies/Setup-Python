<ol>
<li>Start up a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight, or navigate to Applications/Utilities/Terminal.</li>
<li>To start Python, type

<pre>
python
</pre>

at the command prompt and hit enter. You should see something like
<pre>
Python 2.7.1 (r261:67515, Feb 11 2010, 00:51:29) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
</pre>

The <code>>>></code> indicates that you are at a Python prompt.</li>
<li>Exit the Python prompt by typing

<pre>
exit()
</pre>

and hitting enter. Now you're back at the OS X command prompt (which looks something like <code>jesstess$</code>).</li>
</ol>

===Success!===

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
