== To get a compiler on Windows ==

Installing a C compiler on Windows is fairly straightforward.

Start by downloading this program, and running it:

* [http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/5/4/a54badb6-9c3f-478d-8657-93b3fc9fe62d/vcsetup.exe http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/5/4/a54badb6-9c3f-478d-8657-93b3fc9fe62d/vcsetup.exe]

Click next, and agree to the license, if you do agree. We suggest saying no to the two optional components related to Silverlight and SQL. Let it run to the end.

== Test your compiler ==

Open up a command prompt, and type:

<pre>cl</pre>

You should see a helpful version number message.

If you see "Command not found" instead, then get an instructor, and ask for help.
