== To get a compiler on Windows ==

Installing a C compiler on Windows is fairly straightforward.

Start by downloading this program, and running it:

* [http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20120426/mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20120426/mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe]

When prompted, make sure the "GCC" checkbox is checked. Let it run to the end.

== Test your compiler ==

Open up a command prompt, and type:

<pre>c:\mingw\bin\gcc --version</pre>

You should see a helpful version number message.

If you see "Command not found" instead, then get an instructor, and ask for help.
