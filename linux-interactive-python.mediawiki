Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make sure you can start a terminal and run Python from the command line. 

<ol>
<li>Open a Terminal command prompt. You can find the Terminal application at Applications/Accessories/Terminal, or it may already be on your menu bar.</li>
<li>To start Python, type

<pre>
python
</pre>

at the comand prompt and hit enter. You should see something like
<pre>
Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
[GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
</pre>

The <code>>>></code> indicates that you are at a Python prompt.</li>
<li>Exit the Python prompt by typing

<pre>
exit()
</pre>

and hitting enter. Now you're back at the Linux command prompt (which looks something like <code>jesstess$</code>).</li>
</ol>

===Success!===

Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
